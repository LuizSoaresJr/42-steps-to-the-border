32-bit processor
	Standard processor until early 90's.
	Windows 95, 98, XP, Vista, 7, 8 and Linux.
	Operating systems and softwares work  with data that are 32bits long.
	Suport 4GB of RAM.

64-bit processor
	64-bit processor have been in supercomputers since the 70's.
	Started appearing in home computer in the ealry 00's.
	1st AMD64-based processor was released in April 2003.
	Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10; Linux and Mac OS X.
	Suport 16EB of RAM.
	Both 32-bit and 64-bit programs work in a 64-bit processor.
	Can run both types of OS 32-bit ans 64-bit.


Differences between
	64-bit processor comes in dual-core, quad-core, six-core and eight-core.
	Multiple cores increase the number of calculations per second.
	Softwares  that require many colculations function effciciently  on multi-core processors.
	High amounts of RAM  are necessary for graphic design, engineering and video editing programs, because they need to pergorm many calculations to render images.
	Games made for 32-bit processor do not benefit for the extra bits from the 64-bit processor
