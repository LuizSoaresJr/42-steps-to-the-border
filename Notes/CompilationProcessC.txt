Compilation process in C language

1 Pre-processing

	Uses pre-processing program

	1.1 remove comments			//comment
	1.2 macros expansion			#define VAR 13
		the macros are substituted by assembly code
	1.4 file inclusion			#include<something.h>
		the entire <filename.h> is included in the source code
	1.3 process conditional compilation	#ifndef ...
		run or avoid a block of code after checking if macro exists
	
	Return a intermediate file .i with
	no # included				something.i

2 Compiling

	Uses compiling software to covert .i to Assembly file .s
	The whole code is parsed, checking for syntax error and warnings

3 Assembiling

	Use Assembler program
	Converts .s file to object file .o (binary/hexadecimal)

4 Linking

	Include library files .a or .so into program
	Generate an executable file .out
